# Spectrum Theme

Tumblr theme emulating the new dashboard's look and color schemes. I may look at updating this theme in the future to allow for changing color schemes on the fly via JS, but not right now.

### How to Install:
- The full theme code can be found in theme.html, just view the file, click 'raw', and copy the entire page, and then paste it over your exisiting theme's code.
- Detailed installation instructions with screenshots for installing any custom theme can be found on [quickguide.tumblr\.com](https://quickguide.tumblr.com/post/34349589516/how-to-install-tumblr-theme-code).
